<h2>Grower Information</h2>

<h2> How to Design an Annual Flower Container </h2>

<p>
A simple way to design a container is to have a “Thriller, Filler, and Spiller”. 
Thrillers are plants with height that add drama and a vertical element to the combination.  Examples would be spikes, snapdragon, or salvia.  
Fillers tend to be more rounded or mounded plants and make the container look full.  Examples are asparagus fern, calibrachoa, and petunias all make nice fillers.
Spillers are trailing plants that hang over the edge of the planter.  Examples of spillers are bacopa, vinca vine, and ipomea (sweet potato vine).

<p>
Another thing to consider when combining plants is the texture.  Whether the texture is in the leaf or flower, making choices with contrasts will help accentuate the beauty of the other.  Examples of fine textured plants would be asparagus fern, celosia, bacopa, and lobelia.  Coarser textured  plants would be cosmos, coleus, and gerbera daisy.  Mix plants from the fine and the coarse textures and have a lovely planting!
